# VoxelCPP
A simple Voxel Engine project I built for fun and learning, and also as a way for me to practice problem-solving skills, memory managment and optimisations
(I am probably going to go insane trying to implement voxels and having it optimized)

Project uses OpenGL and GLFW, with glad as the wrangler
Other libraries included are:
glm - Used for math/projection stuff
stb_image - Loading images for textures
imgui - GUI implementation for debugging


## Compilation:
Download CMake from this link: https://cmake.org/ and run the build script depending on your platform

For GNU on Windows, you'll have to download mingw either through mysys2[https://www.msys2.org/] or directly from the mingw site[https://www.mingw-w64.org/]
You can also have Visual Studio downloaded and run the "BuildWindows.bat" script in order to compile a project and build from there
On Unix-like operating systems, you may need to install ninja in order to build

So far just tested on a Fedora Linux machine and Windows 11 machine without any problems :D


## TODO:
- Chunk loading
    - Find a way to check how many voxels we are rendering, then maybe try to draw using glDrawArraysInstanced()
- Work on Voxel class
    - Generate buffers, regenerate buffers to optimize, block types, etc.
- LOADSssss of optimizing (culling, lowering tris as much as possible, entity optimization)


## Future plans:
- Procedular terrain generation (Thinking of using a seeded simplex noise implementation with multiple octaves)
- Breaking/Placing blocks
- Physics implementations
- Water?
- Just make fucking minecraft at this point lol
